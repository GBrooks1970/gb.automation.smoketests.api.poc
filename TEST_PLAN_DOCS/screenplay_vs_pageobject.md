# Benefits of Screenplay Pattern Over Page Object Pattern

- **Greater Reusability**
  - Screenplay promotes reusable Tasks and Questions rather than tying logic to specific page structures.

- **Improved Readability**
  - Tests describe **what** the user does, not **how**, aligning closely with business language and BDD.

- **Better Separation of Concerns**
  - Business logic lives in Tasks/Questions, not UI classes—keeping test code clean and DRY.

- **Supports Multi-Actor Scenarios**
  - Easily model complex scenarios with multiple users or roles, which is harder in the Page Object pattern.

- **Easier Maintenance**
  - UI changes affect only the Interactions or Locators, not the high-level Tasks.

- **Consistent Test Flow Abstraction**
  - Abstracts test steps to a higher level of intent—ideal for collaborative Agile teams and BDD workflows.

- **Encourages Domain Language**
  - Improves collaboration between testers, developers, and business analysts by using domain-specific terms in code.

- **Scalable Architecture**
  - Better suited for large test suites and long-term maintainability than Page Object-based approaches.
