# UI Testing Concepts

## Manual Testing Concepts

- **Understand User Journeys**
  - Review business requirements and user stories for the Buy Energy feature
  - Identify key workflows, entry points, and expected outcomes

- **UI Element Validation**
  - Check presence, visibility, and state of critical UI elements (buttons, forms, messages)
  - Validate correct labels, tooltips, and accessibility features

- **Functional Validation**
  - Manually execute core user actions (e.g., login, purchase, navigation)
  - Verify correct UI responses and state changes

- **Boundary & Negative Testing**
  - Enter invalid or edge-case data in forms
  - Validate error messages, input restrictions, and form validation

- **Cross-Browser & Device Testing**
  - Check UI behavior in different browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
  - Validate responsive design on various screen sizes

- **Exploratory Testing**
  - Attempt unexpected actions (e.g., double-clicks, rapid navigation)
  - Identify missing validations or UI inconsistencies

## Automated Testing Concepts

- **Screenplay Pattern**
  - Use the Screenplay pattern to model user interactions as reusable Tasks and Questions
  - Separate business logic from UI locators for maintainability

- **SpecFlow BDD**
  - Write Gherkin scenarios to describe user behaviors in business language
  - Map steps to automation code for traceability

- **Selenium WebDriver**
  - Automate browser actions for end-to-end user flows
  - Locate and interact with UI elements using robust selectors

- **Cross-Browser Automation**
  - Run automated tests on multiple browsers to ensure consistent behavior

- **Assertions & Validation**
  - Assert UI states, element visibility, and expected outcomes after actions
  - Capture screenshots on failure for debugging

- **CI/CD Integration**
  - Integrate UI tests into build pipelines to catch regressions early

## Tools/Libraries Used

- Manual: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Developer Tools
- Automated: SpecFlow, Selenium WebDriver, .NET, Screenplay pattern libraries
